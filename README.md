To compile and run the software, follow these steps:
•	Open a text editor or an integrated development environment (IDE) that supports C# programming, such as Visual Studio or Visual Studio Code.
•	Create a new C# project and name it according to your preference.
•	Copy and paste the provided code into the main source file of your project.
•	Save the file with a .cs extension.
•	Build the project to compile the code. This can usually be done by selecting the "Build" or "Compile" option in your IDE's menu.
•	Once the project is successfully built, you can run the software by executing the compiled program. This can typically be done by selecting the "Run" or "Start" option in your IDE's menu, or by running the compiled executable file.
•	The software will prompt you to enter the recipe details, including the number of ingredients and steps. Follow the prompts and enter the required information.
•	After entering the recipe details, the software will display the recipe, including the ingredients and steps.
•	You will then be prompted to enter a scaling factor to scale the quantities of the ingredients. Enter a valid scaling factor (e.g., 0.5, 2, 3) to scale the recipe quantities accordingly.
•	The software will display the scaled recipe, and you can continue to enter scaling factors or perform other actions as desired.
•	If you want to reset the quantities to their original values, enter "reset" when prompted.
•	If you want to clear all data and enter a new recipe, enter "clear" when prompted.
•	If you enter an invalid input, the software will display an error message and prompt you to try again.
